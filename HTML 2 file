<h1>What is an electric car?</h1>
<p>Electric vehicles (EVs) have a battery instead of a gasoline tank, and an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) are a combination of gasoline and electric vehicles, so they have a battery, an electric motor, a gasoline tank, and an internal combustion engine.

An electric car or battery-electric car is an automobile that is propelled by one or more electric motors, using energy stored in batteries. Compared to internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, electric cars are quieter, have no exhaust emissions, and lower emissions overall.

The total cost of ownership of recent electric vehicles is cheaper than that of equivalent ICE cars, due to lower fueling and maintenance costs. Charging an electric car can be done at a variety of charging stations; these charging stations can be installed in both houses and public areas.

Many countries have established government incentives for plug-in electric vehicles, tax credits, subsidies, and other non-monetary incentives while several countries have legislated to phase-out sales of fossil fuel cars, to reduce air pollution and limit climate change.

In terms of air pollution and greenhouse gas emissions, electric cars and trucks are often cleaner than even the most efficient conventional vehicles. Exactly how clean depends on the type of vehicle and the source of the electricity.

When battery-electric EVs are powered by the cleanest electricity grids, greenhouse gas emissions from EVs are comparable to a car getting over 100 miles per gallon. When charged exclusively with renewable electricity like solar or wind, charging and operating an EV can be nearly emission-free.

<h1>How do electric cars work?</h1>
<p>Electric vehicles (EVs), also referred to as battery electric vehicles, have an electric motor instead of an internal combustion engine. The vehicle uses a large traction battery pack to power the electric motor and must be plugged into a wall outlet or charging equipment, also called electric vehicle supply equipment (EVSE).

Electric car (EV) batteries are charged by plugging the vehicle into an electric power source. Although electricity production may contribute to air pollution, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency categorizes electric vehicles as zero-emission vehicles because they produce no direct exhaust or tailpipe emissions.

Both heavy-duty and light-duty EVs are commercially available. EVs are typically more expensive than similar conventional and hybrid vehicles, although some costs can be recovered through fuel savings, a federal tax credit, or state incentives.</p>

<h1>Plug-In hybrid electric vehicles :</h1>
<p>Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles, or PHEVs, have both an engine and electric motor to drive the car. Like regular hybrids, they can recharge their battery through regenerative braking. They differ from regular hybrids by having a much larger battery and being able to plug into the grid to recharge.

While regular hybrids can (at low speed) travel 1-2 miles before the gasoline engine turns on, PHEVs can go anywhere from 10-40 miles before their gas engines provide assistance. Once the all-electric range is depleted, PHEVs act as regular hybrids, and can travel several hundred miles on a tank of gasoline.

All PHEVs can charge at an EVgo L2 charger, but most PHEVs are not capable of supporting fast charging.

<h1>What fluids do electric cars required?</h1>
<p>While an electric vehicle requires less maintenance, that doesn’t mean you can neglect it. Keep in mind that there’s no such thing as a zero-maintenance vehicle. Although you won’t ever need an EV oil change, you will still need to perform a routine check on the following fluids in EVs:</p>
<h3>1.Coolant</h3>
<p>Heat is a huge issue for electric vehicles, just like it is for fuel-powered vehicles. To manage the heat coming out of your electric car’s lithium-ion battery, the car needs coolant. This is one area where the process is exactly the same for an electric vehicle as it is for a combustion-engine vehicle.

The level of coolant for your car’s battery, power inverter, and cabin heater should all be checked. Although the cabin heater is not a big deal, the other two components are extremely critical.

If you have ever heard a story about an electric car catching on fire, it was probably because of an overheated battery. Thus, keep the coolant levels high to make sure the battery won’t explode.

</p>
<h3>2.Brake Fluid</h3>
<p>While an electric vehicle uses brake pads, they rarely need to be replaced, due to the regenerative braking system on electronic vehicles. The system reduces the wear on the car’s brakes by turning the kinetic energy of a moving vehicle into electric energy to the battery. Essentially, the system is the primary means of slowing the vehicle down, minimizing the amount of wear on brake pads.

The regenerative braking system on an electric car is an important part of the car’s power generation equipment. Typical service for an electronic vehicle involves ensuring that the braking system is working properly, which is extremely important because along with producing power, this is also your primary means of slowing down the vehicle. Because there are major safety implications, you should have your brakes serviced regularly.

</p>
<h3>3.Transmission Fluid</h3>
<P>The multi-speed or direct-drive transmission of an electronic vehicle may require fluid changes during the course of car ownership. It’s important to consult your owner’s manual to find out the recommended interval for completing this service for your specific electric car.</P>
<h1>How far can an electric car go?</h1>
<p>Current electric vehicles travel about 250 miles on a charge, though there are some, such as Tesla’s, that can do about 350 miles on a charge. Many automakers have announced plans to bring to market electric vehicles that promise longer range and even faster charging.

The Future is Now & More Long-Range EVs Coming Soon

Here are a few comparisons of popular electric vehicles that offer more than 200 miles per charge:</p>

<h1>How much electric car cost?</h1>
<p>The average cost of a new car in June 2019 in the U.S. was $36,600. This was a 2% increase from the year before. However, according to data from Cox Automotive, the average cost of an electric vehicle decreased from $64,300 to $55,600: a 13.4% decrease from the year before.

Below is the manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) for several of the leading electric vehicles in the market and their different models:
